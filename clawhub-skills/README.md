## Development

Each skill directory follows the standard OpenClaw skill format:

```
skill-name/
  SKILL.md           # Skill definition (agent prompt + metadata)
  scripts/           # Optional helper scripts
  references/        # Optional API/platform references
```

To test a skill locally, symlink or copy it into your OpenClaw `skills/` directory:

```bash
ln -s "$(pwd)/blog-publisher" ~/.openclaw/skills/blog-publisher
```
